# Product Team

#### Elastos and Cyber Republic is a global project amongst many exciting and professional blockchain projects.

!> Therefore a high emphasis on usability and design is a given and must be maintained.

###### To achieve this all design and product will be placed under a single **Product Team**. Its members will be selected from the CRcles and the best contributors to the CR development projects.

We must ensure that all products created by the official internal development teams go through a rigorous design, usability and testing process.

?> **Please Note:** The product team only oversees the various development projects, which in turn have their own teams of managers and developers.


### Primary Responsibilities

1. Define the goals, brand and style of any development projects

2. Audit, review and test the early versions of the products at various stages to ensure the standard of quality is maintained

3. Ensure each project's milestones are being met and if not advise the Secretariat, Administrators or Council for solutions
