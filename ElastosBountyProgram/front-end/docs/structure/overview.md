## Overview

Cyber Republic is governed by the **Cyber Republic Council (CRC)** which directly communicates with three primary groups:

- [**Token Fund Team**](/structure/token-fund-team.md)
- [**Marketing Council**](/structure/marketing-council.md)
- [**Product Team**](/structure/product-team.md)

?> In charge of enforcing the rules and requirements of each group as defined in this document is the Secretariat and their assistant administrators.

### Current Organization


### 2019 to Q2 - Proposed Organization

!> This is still a **work in progress** as the Chinese and US teams collaborate on an ideal solution.

Some of the primary differences are:

- The **Secretariat Team** will be given extensively more resources to manage, audit and enforce the rules laid out by CRC and this document.

- A new Marketing Council will be formed internally to manage the marketing budget, key changes are also required:
    - [x] enforcement of transparency
    - [x] foster proper data collection of marketing data
    - [x] create accountability for expected goals and decisions

- A new CR **Token Fund Team** in charge of CR100 and investing in dApp projects by the community.

- A dedicated Elastos **Business Development Team** in charge of enterprise partnerships, cryptocurrency exchanges and overall strategy.

- CRcles will be streamlined into less areas than currently and act as a talent pool for the Secretariat team and CR. Some of the CRcles will be absorbed into the **Secretariat Team**.
