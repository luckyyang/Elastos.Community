    <b>2. Pivotal Tracker Velocity (Weekly) -</b>
    <span style="font-size: 14px;">should be broken down by project</span>
</summary>

This is our agile/sprint project management software. It uses a common fibonacci point scheme for task difficulty:

For individual tasks the points correspond to the following time to complete:
- 1 = 15-30 minutes
- 2 = 1-2 hours
- 3 = one day (5-7 hours)
- 5 = 2-3 days
- 8 = 3-5 days
- 13 = a week

Generally a full-time developer should average 15-18 points a week, so a velocity of 50 would correspond to 3 developers

*TODO: in the future we want to track efficiency, so points per developer, but this needs to be normalized and our hourly tracking is not accurate enough*
