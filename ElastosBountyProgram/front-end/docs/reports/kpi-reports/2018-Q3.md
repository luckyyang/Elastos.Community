# KPI Report for 2018 Q3 (Work in Progress)

!> This is still a WORK IN PROGRESS!

?> This is the first KPI Report, it's important to note that no metrics were tracked until starting May 2018 when the US Tech Team officially came online.

This can be assumed to be first full quarter that the US Tech Team were able to focus on our KPIs. From May to June the team spent most of its time doing
tours and building a community and ambassadors in key regions.
