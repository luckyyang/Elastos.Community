# Token Fund Team

### Mandate

The token fund team is an investment team responsible for finding, researching and helping to select the best projects for Elastos to kick start/seed invest in.
Each quarter the team will have a budget that is approved by the CRC, the secretariat will ensure that the request is reasonable and follow up on the KPIs.


### Key Rules

1. **Project Selection** - the CRC and the Token Fund Team will both select an equal number of projects to fund from a pool of qualified projects.
To ensure a healthy selection of candidates, the CRC can only select 35% of the candidates and the Token Fund Team may select another 35%. This means that for every 14 selected
candidates, the Token Fund Team must find 20 qualifying candidates (rounded down).

2. **Funding by Milestones** - the Token Fund Team must clearly define multiple milestones for each project, a portion of the funding will be attached to each milestone.

3. **Seed Investment Only** - our investments are meant to kick start the projects only and are not meant to fund the project in its entirety. It is expected that progress advances
fast enough to ensure the project has enough funding through its own token. If this is not feasible it should be caught in the project selection stage or as soon as possible at the milestones.
Should this still happen an audit/review will be necessary and possible escalation to the CRC.

### Policies

- The fund will be held by a multi-signature wallet owned by the lead investor, an Elastos Foundation member and the Secretariat

- All leads, opportunities and contacts must be entered into the CRM and shared with other members of the team

- Each quarter of the year, the team must submit a funding request document with KPIs/goals at the start.
At the end of the quarter another report is required describing the current state of all investments and comparisons with goals

- The team will take a **management fee equal to a percentage of the fund** which will be held in a separate wallet. From this wallet the members of the teams
will deduct their agreed upon pay on a semi-monthly basis in ELA. The management fee funds will also be used to create CR tasks for CRcles to help the Token Fund Team in any way necessary.

- Each project invested in will require an analysis report which includes information including but not limited to: funding, technical milestones, expected ROI, deliverables
and the contractual agreement on how many tokens will be allocated to Elastos

### Team Composition and Rationale

The team initially will be formed of three members

- **Lead Investor** - leads the token fund team, finds leads, defines the criteria to judge projects and has major decision making power over which projects are invested in

- **Assistant Investor** - assists other investors, manages financial records, goal estimation and following up with project milestones

- **Technical Adviser** - advises on which projects are feasible and helps review funding requirements to ensure they are realistic


#### Team Growth

The team will be selected from active and motivated individuals in the CR community and grow from there.

In the future we would like to hire more experienced investors with actual industry or VC experience. We are not looking for these right now, as the Token Team is still in its infancy and such investors would be too expensive.
We also believe that experienced investors are only necessary when we are trying to select a unicorn from many strong candidates, and where discerning which projects have the most potential is difficult.
Given the quality of applications we've seen so far we do not believe there will be enough amazing projects to warrant looking for stronger investors yet.
