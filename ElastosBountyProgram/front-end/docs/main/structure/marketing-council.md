# Marketing Council

Marketing and PR must have a single brand and voice, also marketing inherently requires coordination between different marketing campaigns and strategies.

?> The **Marketing Council** is only in charge of the budget and evaluating the performance of the different marketing agencies/teams


### The Marketing Coordinator

Under the Marketing Council a marketing coordinator will ensure that the different marketing agencies/teams do not overlap regions or marketing channels.

This is important because marketing data all flows to a small set of data analytics tools. To ensure that the data is not
mixed up with different campaigns or another team's data, the coordinator is necessary.


### Marketing Agency - Ladder.io, CR Growth Team

At the moment Ladder.io is funded by Elastos and only promotes Elastos, however once CR is online all Global PR and Marketing will be
moved to Cyber Republic except for the Chinese side of things.
