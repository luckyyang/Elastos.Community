!> By Matthew Lee, Clarence Liu

## Required Information

- Budget: **500k USD**

- Management Fee: **10%** / **50k USD**

- Team Size: **3**

- Term: **Dec 2018 to Mar 2019**

- Expected Projects Invested: **6**

- Average Investment: **75k USD**

- Average Equity Received per Investment: **5%**


## Phases

### 1. Dec 2018 - **Exploratory Phase** - Defining Key Metrics and Project Selection Criteria/Grading Scheme

###### The first month will be spent researching and training the new team, key goals are:

- Define the project selection criteria

- Define the categories of dApps and specific criteria for them

- Create a grading scheme based on the criteria

- Create good investment research documentation

- Training and recruiting new team members, establishing contact with established investment/VC firms

- Reviewing the current set of applicants/teams and ranking those for consideration for Phase 2

Initially we propose to have a team with Matthew Lee as the **Lead Investor** and two temporary members from Elastos until
we find replacements. Cassie Zhang the new full-time Administrator will act as the **Assistant Investor** and Clarence Liu from the US Tech Team will fill in as
the **Technical Adviser**. This initial team will lay the groundwork for the future Token Fund Team.


### 2. Jan - Feb 2018 - **Research/Collaboration Phase** - Working with the Best Candidates/Teams to Develop their Whitepapers

During this phase we will also be seeing the Smart Contract platform available for the first time, so we expect it to take a bit of time for all the teams to ramp up.
We will be working closely with the best teams we selected in Phase 1 on their business plans, whitepapers and technical designs.
The ultimate goal is to qualify a set of candidates for selection by the CRC and the Token Fund Team, this will be
run as a competition of sorts because in the Token Fund Team rules only 60% of the qualified applications will be funded.

## Strategy - By Matthew Lee


Funding the projects that would best utilize the unique advantages that Elastos can offer is our goal. Such advantages are the ability to run on any operating system, which allows for infinite scalability, and the security of the Bitcoin hash power. Given these advantages, it becomes clear to me that the DApps that will thrive on Elastos are ones that will have trouble being replicated on other Blockchains. Such types of DApps are ones where a high tps is required, such as messaging apps and ride-sharing services. The security of Elastos enables the viability of DApps where there are many sensitive records, such as the storage of Hospital files or Real Estate titles.

The CR100 is the flagship project of Elastos, but I don’t expect there to be applications for every single category. Should this be the case, the token team will invest in more than one project in the DApp category. This is not due to a lack of good investment options. Rather, this is to create greater competition in a specific category, and to ensure Elastos will be equity owners in each leader.

I don’t believe in only choosing the winners. It’s impossible to know exactly who will be the winners, and anyone who claims to have only invested in the winners is a liar. However, I do believe that the more you bet, the more you win. I believe that by only searching for the 2-3 killer dapps and only investing in those few, one greatly increases the chances of missing other successes. Casting a wider net will also decrease the idiosyncratic risk of each investment.

## Example


For instance, one of the most exciting projects that I can’t wait to fund is projects in IoT. Because IoT is so new and innovative, it is impossible to guess which single project will be the winner. In order to ensure Elastos has equity in the one that does get it right, I plan on investing in several such IoT projects. Without this investment strategy of casting a wide net, I am unable to successfully invest in things that are new and innovative. This does not mean the Token Team will invest in every project, rather it means that we don't feel a need to only choose one when there are several great opportunities.

## Use of Funds


The amount that I’m requesting is very high, but that is because if I’m paid via management fee, the amount has to be high in order to have enough funds not only for myself but to pay others. Others will eventually be hired to join the Token Team. Furthermore, I plan on creating tasks with generous rewards for helping in finding the best DApps to invest in. I have interacted with the people in Elastos CRCLES on numerous occasions and I can guarantee that they are as excited about Elastos succeeding as I am. I plan on utilizing their enthusiasm to help the investments. The 10% management fee will cover the bounties for such tasks.

## Forecasts


The funding that will be given is only seed funding. The equity the Token Team receives per investment will be in the DApp's native token. It is up to each project to raise additional funding on their own afterwards. We are expecting an ROI of 5x in USD by the time they launch and hit exchanges, after which we will carefully decide whether to sell our tokens or to hold them based on careful and thorough analysis of the project. In terms of number of users, we expect an annual ROI of at least 50% per investment. Given that the Token Team will only be issuing seed money, we expect a period of 1-2 years after our initial investment before the project's tokens hit exchanges, and 1 year therafter before mainnet.
